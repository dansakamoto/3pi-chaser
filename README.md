# 3pi-chaser

Scaredybots is a scene in which two creatures trapped in a labyrinth, searching for a way out. Each has a single sense for detecting danger; one can detect light, the other can detect physical objects. Although they donâ€™t pose a threat to each other, each possesses a trait that makes it frightening to the other.

As they are left to explore and interact with each other, we are able to simultaneously observe them from above, as if creatures in a zoo, or we can witness their struggle from their own point of view.
